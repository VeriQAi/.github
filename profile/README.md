## Why These Two Apps?

**The Problem:** Traditional assignment workflows are broken
- Educators spend **3+ hours** formatting assignments in Word/Google Docs  
- Students submit messy, inconsistent work that's hard to grade
- No easy way to track AI usage in student work
- Gradescope requires specific PDF formats that are tedious to create

**The Solution:** A complete digital workflow
1. **Assignment Maker** - Create structured, professional assignments in minutes
2. **Student Submission** - Students complete work in guided format, auto-generate grading-ready PDFs  

**The Result:** Transform 3+ hour workflows into 15-minute processes while improving consistency and academic integrity.
