# VeriQAi

### Empowering educators worldwide through intelligent, accessible AI solutions that transform teaching and learning.

## 🎯 Who We Are

**VeriQAi** builds intelligent tools that help educators teach better. We're teachers and technologists who understand the daily challenges of education—from creating assignments at midnight to managing hundreds of student submissions.

We believe that cutting-edge AI should be accessible and affordable to every educator, regardless of institution size, budget, or technical expertise.

### 🎯 VeriQAi Mission: Transforming Busywork into Learning Time

Our mission is simple: **Transform hours of teaching busywork into minutes, so you can spend more time connecting with your students and teaching.**

VeriQAi is dedicated to improving the integrity and quality of the digital learning experience. Our tools are built on the mission that **students should spend their time learning, not wrestling with administrative technology.**

### 🔍 Addressing the Gradescope Efficiency Gap

To fulfill this mission, we've focused on one of the most costly inefficiencies in large-scale course management: **the trade-off required for assessing written take-home assignments** (Homework, Lab Reports, etc.) within the Gradescope ecosystem.

We identified a workflow gap where the platform's assignment types force instructors to choose between **student submission convenience** and **grading efficiency**. This technical trade-off costs educators thousands of hours in lost time every semester.


Our most impactful solution, **GradeBridge**, tackles a persistent inefficiency in the Gradescope ecosystem that creates friction for both students and instructors managing large, written assignments.

## 🛑 The Core Problem: The Gradescope Trade-Off (Efficiency vs. Student Experience)

Faculty rely on Gradescope's **AI-Assisted Grading and Answer Grouping** for the crucial **40-60% grading time savings** they offer. This powerful efficiency is fundamentally tied to **Fixed Length/Templated** assignments.

When assessing **Homework, Lab Reports, and Problem Sets**, the current Gradescope assignment types force a trade-off that creates substantial human cost:

| Assignment Type | AI-Assisted Grading Status | The Instructor's Loss |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Online Assignment** (Web-Form) | **NOT available.** | **Zero AI Time Savings.** Explicitly confirmed: "*AI-assisted grading and answer-grouping are not possible...*" |
| **Variable Length** (Non-Templated PDF) | **NOT available.** | **Zero AI Time Savings.** Explicitly confirmed: "*...do not support AI-assisted grouping.*" |
| **Fixed Length/Templated** (Template Required) | **IS available, BUT...** | **Compliance Burden.** Grader time fixing errors often *negates* the entire 40-60% AI time saving. |

### The Human Cost: Friction for Students and Graders

The technical trade-off above translates directly into wasted effort and frustration:

#### 😩 Student Experience: Learning Time Lost
Students spend valuable time on technical hurdles instead of content mastery:
* **Mixed-Media Formatting:** Struggling to digitize and merge handwritten notes, typed text, and complex diagrams into a single, compliant PDF.
* **Procedural Errors:** Clerical mistakes from manually mapping answers in **Variable Length** submissions, leading to workflow disruption and potential grade penalties.
* **Technical Barriers:** Dealing with incompatible image formats, PDF assembly issues, and frustrating upload failures.

#### 😫 Instructor & Grader Burden: Time Spent on Admin, Not Feedback
Faculty and TAs lose critical time and efficiency dealing with compliance issues:
* **Significant Upfront Setup:** Faculty waste approximately **8 hours per assignment** in laborious template creation, scanning, and region marking.
* **Workflow Inefficiencies:** Graders are forced to waste time searching for misplaced answers, breaking the intended efficient grading flow.
* **Technical Support:** TAs act as technical support for submission issues, diverting them from providing academic feedback.

## 🛑 The Core Problem: The Gradescope Trade-Off for Written Assignments

Faculty utilize Gradescope's **AI-Assisted Grading and Answer Grouping** for the crucial **40-60% grading time savings** they offer. This powerful efficiency is fundamentally tied to **Fixed Length/Templated** assignments, which work well for in-person exams but introduce major friction for take-home work.

When assessing **Homework, Lab Reports, and Problem Sets**, instructors are currently forced to choose between **student convenience** and **grading efficiency** due to Gradescope's assignment type limitations.

| Assignment Type | Gradescope Feature Status | The Instructor's Loss |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Online Assignment** (Web-Form) | **AI-Assisted Grading is NOT available.** | **Zero AI Time Savings.** Explicitly confirmed: "*AI-assisted grading and answer-grouping are not possible on any answer field...*" |
| **Variable Length** (Non-Templated PDF) | **AI-Assisted Grouping is NOT available.** | **Zero AI Time Savings.** Explicitly confirmed: "*...do not support AI-assisted grouping.*" |
| **Fixed Length/Templated** (Template Required) | **AI-Assisted Grading IS available, BUT...** | **Compliance Burden.** The time spent manually fixing non-compliant student submissions often *negates* the entire 40-60% time saving. |

### The Cost of Incompatibility: Burden on Students and Graders

The technical trade-off above translates directly into significant **human friction** and time wasted across the assessment process:

#### 😩 Student Frustrations
Students face substantial technical hurdles that divert time away from learning:
* **Mixed-Media Formatting:** Struggling to digitize and merge handwritten notes (photos), typed text, and complex diagrams into a single, correctly formatted PDF.
* **Procedural Errors:** Clerical errors from manually mapping questions to pages in **Variable Length** assignments, which can lead to grade deductions or workflow errors.
* **Technical Barriers:** Dealing with incompatible formats (like .heic), PDF assembly issues, and file size limits.

#### 😫 Instructor & Grader Burden
Faculty and TAs lose critical time and efficiency due to submission problems:
* **Upfront Time Investment:** Faculty waste approximately **8 hours per assignment** in laborious template creation, scanning, and region marking.
* **Workflow Inefficiencies:** Graders must waste time hunting for misplaced answers in submissions with clerical errors, disrupting the efficient horizontal grading flow.
* **Technical Support:** TAs spend unnecessary time acting as first-line technical support for student PDF, image, and upload issues (estimated to be reduced by **70%** by GradeBridge).
