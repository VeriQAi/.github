## 🎯 The Gradescope Problem We Solve

**Gradescope's AI-assisted grading saves 40-60% of grading time** - but only works with templated PDFs. This forces educators into a costly trade-off:

- ✅ **Use templates** → Get AI efficiency BUT students struggle with rigid formatting (8+ hours instructor setup)
- ✅ **Skip templates** → Easy submissions BUT lose all AI time savings

**The hidden cost:** Thousands of hours lost every semester to this forced choice.
